![alt-text](https://github.com/mbspcruz/portal/blob/main/assets/prtal.png?raw=true)

A Portal scene made in Blender and imported with three.js.
There's use of shaders to create the portal animation, and you can see a change when it's activated by hovering the cursor over it. 
It was part of a lesson in threejs journey and you can interact with it in https://portal3js.netlify.app/.
